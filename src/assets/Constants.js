    BIO: 'Software engineer from Kauai, based in San Diego. I have my bachelor\'s degree in Computer Science from Colorado State University. I have knowledge in both frontend and backend programming, along with database management. I am currently working at Digital Media Solutions where I am an active part of all steps of the software development life cycle including designing, developing, testing, and deploying production-level code. One thing I love about software engineering is working in a team setting and collaborating with those around me. I am eager to learn and I am always pushing myself to be the best that I can.',

        DESCRIPTION: 'React app used to calculate best possible move for card game. Start by placing 9 cards in a 3x3 grid face up. Players take turns picking any one card on the table to guess \'higher\', \'lower\', or \'same\' on. If you get it right, place the new card on the pile and move on to the next player. If you get it wrong, place the new card on the pile and flip the pile, it can not be used for the rest of the game. Aces are high. The object of the game is to get rid of all 52 cards before you run out of piles. This app is mean\'t to be used while playing the game with a real deck of cards. As the cards are being placed on the table, use this app to re-create the state of the game. Once the initial 9 cards are dealt, the app will automatically compute and display the best possible move. Have fun and good luck!  p.s. this game gets it\'s name due to how difficult it is to actually win (even while playing with the best odds) so don\'t feel bad if it takes you a few times to win.',
