    BIO: 'Software engineer from Kauai, based in San Diego. I have my bachelor\'s degree in Computer Science from Colorado State University. I have knowledge in both frontend and backend programming, along with database management. I am currently working at Digital Media Solutions where I am an active part of all steps of the software development life cycle including designing, developing, testing, and deploying production-level code. One thing I love about software engineering is working in a team setting and collaborating with those around me. I am eager to learn and I am always pushing myself to be the best that I can.',
